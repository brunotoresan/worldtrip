## 🔥 About the project
This is a traveling app where users can check continents, read about its description, and check its most famous cities!

## 🌵 Fake API with JSON Server
We will use JSON server to simulate a REST API that will make the data in the `server.json` file available in both the `http://localhost:3333/continents` and `http://localhost:3333/continentsWithCities` urls

## 👨🏽‍💻 About the challenge
This was a challenge to implement a responsive traveling app through a figma layout. I developed the app with several cool technologies such as:
- Chakra UI to create responsive interfaces for a great experience in both cellphones and computers
- Next.JS framework to create a complete web application from React
- Swiper to create to create a touch slider

## 💻 Installation and execution
To install: `yarn install`<br>
To create fake API with JSON sevrer: `yarn server`<br>
To run the React App: `yarn start`
